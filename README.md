# Polished Quartz

Polished Quartz follows my efforts to understand a specific part of Minecraft Bedrock addon development -- creating a new project for version 1.19.40. This update had some breaking changes that I can't fix in existing projects, so I'm going to try building from scratch and seeing what breaks.

## Roadmap

1. Follow the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptinggettingstarted)
1. Try to recreate it with [Regolith v1.0.1](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/)
