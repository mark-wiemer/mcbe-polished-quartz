# Polished Quartz

Polished Quartz follows my efforts to understand a specific part of Minecraft Bedrock addon development -- creating a new project for version 1.19.40. This update had some breaking changes that I can't fix in existing projects, so I'm going to try building from scratch and seeing what breaks.

## Installation

1. Copy this folder
1. Follow [chapter 2 of official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptinggettingstarted#chapter-2-lets-test-the-parts-of-our-project):
   1. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in PowerShell
   1. Run `gulp`
   1. Add the add-on to a world with the "Beta APIs" flag enabled

## Done

1. Create project following the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptinggettingstarted): See [commit 7e65a6a](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/mcbr-polished-quartz/tree/7e65a6a94036300ffe3a84768ef33e3c8b1bf87f)
